# ChemDesign: DWSIM Experiment Toolkit

## Introduction

ChemDesign: DWSIM Experiment Toolkit is a groundbreaking toolkit designed to revolutionize the way you perform Design of Experiments (DOE) within the DWSIM open source chemical process simulation software. This toolkit aims to simplify and automate the DOE process, enabling engineers, researchers, and students to optimize their chemical process designs with greater efficiency and accuracy.

## Key Features
* Seamless Integration with DWSIM: Designed to work flawlessly with DWSIM, providing a smooth workflow for conducting experiments.

* Automation of DOE Processes: Automates the cumbersome steps involved in the DOE, from setup to execution and analysis, saving valuable time and reducing the potential for human error.

* Intuitive User Interface: Features an easy-to-use interface that guides users through the process of designing and running experiments.
